      that's pre-paint and paint
      does it change if I scroll?

      weird pauses in the function execution graph

  looks linear
  attaching text node before makes layout calculations a wee bit shorter 

just creating text nodes
  1e7 - ~10s

just creating elements
  1e7 - ~13s

attaching elements just to the top node
replacing top node with pre-rendered tree
replacing part of detached tree



why so few calls in the profiler

does dom update before the function exits?

do results vary wildly when repeating those benchmarks?

hidden stuff
