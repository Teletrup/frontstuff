why use frontend frameworks anyway?
  editing DOM is painful and slow

imperative updates

==================================================
;FRAMEWORKS

frontend framework comparison

angular
  looks bloated
  relatively poor opinions

vue
  supposedly simpler than react
  
react
  components defined as JS classes

preact
  react but tinier?
  a lot of imports
  some scheme virtual dom project uses it


elm
  forces view-model architecture
    might be useful to analyze
  a lot of boilerplate?

svelte
  not a framework

understand code generated by svelte

preact

==================================================
;TEST CASE

simple tree view with "boring" tasks as leaves
  each task
    displays
      question
      an answer box
      streak
        red after wrong answer
        black otherwise
    when user presses 'enter' while the box is focused, the question gets updated

tic tac toe - like in react tutorial?

generalized tic-tac-toe

board representation:
  a 2d array

highlighting rows

Sierpi≈Ñski's carpet using tables
  zoomable
    culling invisible elements

tile display with table borders


==================================================
;REACT

JSX
  is a syntax extension to JS that lets one write React elements using a language that
  looks like HTML

element vs component
  element is an object based on which React creates a DOM node

bundler and stuff

parcel?
  builds stuff worse than rust

devtools

explain props and state

props are like arguments, but reactive
  does that make sense?

reactivity happens only at props
  rly?

trace the update

triggering the reaction

reactivity vs declarativity

component and element

what setState actually does
  as opposed to assigning property?
    updates reactive stuff?

==================================================
;PREACT

glossary
  component
  prop
  vdom
  htm
  hyperscript

explain reactivity and update propagation

hyperscript
htm 

hooks
  why do they exist?
    something something composition?
  when do they get called?
  are they unnecessary work?

signals
  so AFAIK they make it so you can update stuff without it propagating through props
  where in unpkg???
  what's borken?

htm with multiple top level elements
htm of nothing
variadic function that prints its args

reducer and other hooks
how do hooks work anyway

write as hyperscript
  [move to frontcomp]

"only stuff that changes should be passed as props"
  rly?
  what about square indices in tic-tac-toe?

classes vs closures
  are closures less efficient?
  does V8 handle that?


does an element get re-rendered when its state changes?

leaky abstractions?

how slow is htm


==================================================
;ELM

elm architecture in JS

learn a bit of haskell first


==================================================
;VANILLA


reactivity without virtual DOM?
  inspect what "render" does in preact
  how events work
  hyperscript!

so the constructor should create an object in a well defined state

task
  state
    question
    streak
  constant functions
    answer - update element after an answer
  supplied functions
    generate - update question state
    validate - quesiton validation
    ask - format question


^^
  so that's a typical OOP way of thinking about stuff
    which isn't necessarily wrong
  which functions are passed in as constructor arguments?
    generate, ask, validate
  it would be much harder to think about this sorts of stuff if I didn't muck about
    with the hacky version
  does this apply to vanilla only?
    if so, it shouldn't

butchering the old code?


init/update

input event
  update?
  update('ans')

update vs show
  reactivity

do the vanilla case last

==================================================
;CUSTOM

==================================================
;BROWSER

rendering

SVG

DOM & CSSOM

why CSS exists?

timing the pipeline

sniffin' syscalls

CSS
  float in react tic tac toe
  colon

timing dom update for detached elements

==================================================
;VIRTUAL DOM

sniffing updates


==================================================
;JS

empty JS arrays

Array(10) vs array.from

adding properties to prototype vs newly constructed object
  nested?

==================================================
;UI

PPI-aware UI?

tic tac toe board
  can't it just be done with 2 flex boxes?
    one horizontal, one vertical

miniature of arbitrary component?
  google it

buttons
  so adding border removes animation

selectable palette for the whole site

nice graphs

==================================================
;UNCATEGORIZED

custom reducer
  overgeneralization?
    write both smart version and a dumb version
    dumb version first
      8 minutes, 40 seconds

dumber?
  checking and coloring at once
    call it updateWinner

more imperative way?
  no maps, no recursion

nested iterators?
lambda iterator?


what is the user agent anyway?


is there some smarty-pants way to not repeat myself when coloring stuff after winning?

inspect htm via custom bind
  just console.log?
  read the docs
render without HTM

onkeydown fires for backspace while onkeypress doesn't

is webpack also bloated?

listing imports and exports of a given package

what works
  preact from unpkg & skypack
what doesn't work
  signals from unpkg
    did I really test that?
  signals from skypack

what now
  preact step by step
    recreate previous functionality

does Google work in an iframe if I launch chromium with --disable-web-security?

why do I even need a proxy to fake CORS?
  is that sentence even meaningful?

how does yarn link registration work

sandboxing

how do scripts get loaded with iframes
  do they go away when the iframe gets deleted?

what's react router?

@ in npm packages

pixel scale

including stuff from unpkg
  can I just install them locally and include them?
  wget-a-link
  ?module

so what now?
  react
  modules without node
    text/module?
    exporting
    importing
  gomoku with hooks


parcel without optimizers?

weird "zajeba"
  didn't expect static files to reload on page refresh

cool stuff to build
  side summary thingy
    nav?

hot reload?
  there's a package for that

global install with node without repetition

github pages?
  link modules

hypothesis
  frameworks do init/update automagically

custom lisp

look into virtual dom in preact
flux n' stuff

timing things when thinking about performance

how long does it take to generate the virtual DOM?
how long does it take to render the DOM?
